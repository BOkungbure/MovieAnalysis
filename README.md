# MovieAnalysis
In the Movie_dataset notebook
These are the libraries being used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Motivation:
My recent 3 hour run of Oppenheimer gave me the impression that movie studios had started churning out lengthier titles for consumers,
While, I enjoy a good story as much as the next person, I wanted to be sure this wasn't a trend movie goers would need to get used to,
I don't believe a average runtimes of 2 hours are sustainable for studios and fans alike. In order to answer this question,
I used an Imdb dataset to seek answers to the following questions
- What is the average runtime of movies in the last 7 decades
- Do the runtimes affect the popularity of the title, are longer movies favoured over shorter ones
- What studio has the highest total profit within this same time period

# File Description
- Movie_Dataset.ipynb: notebook containing the data analysis
- tmdb-movies.csv: csv file containing movie information
- README.md: readme document with the summary of the project details


# Summary of Results
After goign through the data, it was refreshing to see that contrary to my suspicions, movie runtimes have actually reduced considerably through the years, from an average of almost 3 hours between the 60s & 70s to just under 2hrs in the 2010s, also from all indications, it seems the longer a movie is, the less popular it is and finally, paramount pictures are the most profitable studio in the last 7 decades, I've captured all my thoughts in a blog post here https://medium.com/@babatundeokungbure/how-have-movies-runtimes-gotten-longer-996c22150877
